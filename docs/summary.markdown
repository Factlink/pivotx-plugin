Great discussions on your site
=================

Readers join discussions inside your articles and invite their friends. You get engaged users, and more of them.

Focussed discussions
-----------------

Have discussions where they belong. Donâ€™t let quibble over details swamp other comments. Users will vote for the best discussions, and the best points made in your articles. Inline comments add a layer of lively debate to otherwise passive content. Give your visitors the opportunity to discuss directly with the author, turning a monologue into a conversation.

Higher engagement and retention
-----------------

Visitors start discussing in your article while reading. They get immediately engaged, so they stick around longer. When the discussion progresses, your visitors get notified and will come back to your site.

Social reach
-----------------

We make it easy for readers to invite their Facebook friends and Twitter followers to join the discussion. In addition, Factlink itself is a social network for knowledge, where users can subscribe to discussions on your website, and discover new content.
